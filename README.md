**<h1>Portfolio (in processâŒ›)</h1>**

This is the Github repository of my Portfolio, where you can view projects, experience and more about my career as a developer.<br><br>

**<h2>Used technologies</h2>**
It is a Front-End project made with:

**<h2>Demo (not available yet)</h2>**
This project is still in process, so there is currently no live view. It is taking me too long to make this Portfolio because I am putting all my love and quality into it. I was able to simply copy and paste a portfolio made by someone on YouTube, but I want to do it with my effort and refine the smallest detail, because it is my presentation of life, and I love to do this with my own styleðŸ¤ .

**<h2>Installation and running</h2>**
To run the project locally and check the code in depth, you can do the following:

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone <url>
```

### 2. Client Installation
A command window should be opened inside the "portfolio-client" folder and the following commands are entered:
```
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Enjoy!
Once running the project you can explore it as much as you want ðŸ˜€.

**<h2>Challenges during development</h2>**
As I mentioned above, this project was complicated, since I wanted to put a lot of quality and attention to detail, import as little as possible from libraries and do most of it on my own to demonstrate my skills.

Everything was made from scratch, the Navbar, the customizable buttons with their wave effect, etc. I could have saved weeks of work just using ready-made components, but I wanted to do it with my effort to make it 99% custom and made by me.
<br><br>

**<h2>Learning</h2>**
Making this project from scratch and having to do everything myself helped me a lot in refining my use of React.js, TypeScript, CSS, and HTML. I learned new knowledge that will help me for future projects.

The most important thing is that it helped me to understand how the technologies I used work in depth, since normally when using libraries or ready-made components, the fact of how they work in depth is not considered, but this helped me a lot in having a perspective more espacious.

All these learnings made me understand that it was not a waste of time to do it from scratch (I was able to free myself from weeks of work), since I was able to improve my programming logic and my work methodology.
